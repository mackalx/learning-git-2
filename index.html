      <div class="stanza">
        <p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
           Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;<br>
           If you can trust yourself  when all men doubt you,<br>
           But make allowance for their doubting too:<br>
           If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
           Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
           Or being hated don’t give way to hating,<br>
           And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>If you can dream — and not make dreams your master<br>
           If you can think — and not make thoughts your aim,<br>
           If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
           And treat those two impostors just the same:<br>
           If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br>
           Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
           Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
           And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools;</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
           And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
           And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
           And never breathe a word about your loss:<br>
           If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
           To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
           And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
           Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
           Or walk with Kings — nor lose the common touch,<br>
           If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
           If all men count with you, but none too much:<br>
           If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
           With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
           Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
           And — which is more — you’ll be a Man, my son!</p>
